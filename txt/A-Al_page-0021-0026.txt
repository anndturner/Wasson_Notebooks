27 II 88 DJM ALLAN HILLS 481014 0.22±0.03. Bandurdth 0.1 0.2 mm. Kanacite bands surround elongated groups of carbideschreibersite crystals in many places. Fusion crust rims the entire curved surface. bands are Fez C (JTW) or In cel of lamellae. Fe₂ Roy Clarke (1984) calls this an ataxite, He observed only schreibersite, no other inclusions.

Altonah (Utah, USA) 11 Nov 66. Small 1.0 x 0.5 cm sample, remnant of larger piece from USNM. Polished and etched 30sec in nital. Sample will be compared to Duchesne, on which I just took notes, Structure is distinct, but somewhat less so than with D. The ham bands are long, and have distival this teenite borders. There is a large amount of plessite, perhaps 30% whole area, at least half of which has 14 - her transformed to long kam bands ~ 18 = 1/10 thickness of req ham bands. The latter are typically 9.15-0.3 mm wide, thus Of Maridation in this swoall sample D. does not show banded plessite. I tentatively conclude that altoral & D. are not a paired falls. x no inclusions
