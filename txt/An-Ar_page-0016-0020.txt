Tacrite bands have disappeared in most cases, but some taenite and even plessite remains. One band which is definitly oriented is 2.7 mm wide before it disappears, another news to be 2.2 mm. Surface has munitions black spots. Under 90x I can't tell is they are taveite, carbon, or schreibersile. No obvious cohenite is visible, but some schreibernit is present along grain boundaries. Suryace No oxidation Cobserved fall): has many heumann lines
