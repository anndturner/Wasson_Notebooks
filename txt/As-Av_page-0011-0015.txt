ASM 009 = NWA 4708 from Birdwell JTW 21 Feb 07 This is a medium actahedrite with remarkably for inclusions. My guess is that it is low-N: ITAB. ~ 0.85 ± 0.15. Buen thích The kam bandwidth is I see one round troildte with a draineter D.9 wewe and another roughly rectangular R0.4 X NO.8 mm.

ASM 005 - NWA 47004 = 219 end mass Med. Oct, band width 0.70 ±0.10. Bands are short, swollen, but no inclusions visible in the centers, I see no Fes and no schreibersite that is + N 1.5 cm Thicks clearly identifiable. The sample in crossed by swall cracks showing oxidation (very minor) at edges. Pleasite, mainly dark gray or finely banded, is abundant, ~ 30 to 35% zove 35 of the the area No heat attered

ASM 003 372 NWA 4702. 19 Feb 2007 - a for INAA This sample is an end section of meteoriile with total mass 123g. Athough the saved on the received wass had been polished and etched, the structure is essentially nondescript under the binocular scope. We will prepare polested thick section to obtain wore details. The structure is face a (no C particles, at in a gray but I worry that it might be terrestrial, There ar shape after its saub D A forth seat carbon steel) fine "microrhabdite" linear features

ASM 011 101945 JTW 15 Feb 2007 Very beautiful fine octahedrite; band with ~0.4±0.1 mu. Structure essentially the same an ASM 007. Much shorphisle in the interiors of grains; almost wildegr every phamacile has nwall phosphides with seges of ~0,1-0,2 X@O. 2 to 0.4 Some have one or two facets. No Fes.

There is a cluster of bands renung up the center of the specumin, dividing it into two "halver". I show this on in pencil. on the sketch. One the bollow side nearly all the bands are parallel in the direction shown on sketch. On the top side bands. with 4 seti notch 19 * top 9 very There slab, ech on both surfaces bottom *~1 mm thick of this septum the Widman. pattern is more conventional, The sample contains lots of plessile perhaps with a range of in most octahedral orientation, I would plessite. wo bandwondthe guess that it contains 40% ate I see no Fes and firmly identiped schreib. However, to al various locations in the central septure what appear to be vilicates. My first guess is that they are Bridymile'; my guess is olivive. Typical seizes are 0.5+1.0 mm up to 110x 2.0 mm. They appear to have been angular of faceted before a late shack event seduced the grain size and caused the faces to be shighly irrespelar. At the left end of secoud over
