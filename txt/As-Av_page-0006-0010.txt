Avec L 27 Italy) to Avée Je returned 21 Jeb 67. Sample from Vienna, wt ~ 4g; Prior - Hey state that are is a hexahedrile fall. This is a weathered octahedrite, seemingly too weathered to be a fall. Polished and etched 60 sec vital. Prominent num. lives in kam. Plessite some fine + dark, some banded, ~ Numerous smell inclusions, in kam or cross grain boundaries: I orignally thought these were cobenite, but they bronze like trailite, I simply don't know for sure. One small 2 mm schreib nodule exposed on crust edge. sample weathered on "crust" side cond also pitted on polished surface. Sample will not be lacquered because of pits in "troilite", which could not be cleaned once filled with lacquer. Kam bund 1.4-1.8mm 5% of Og area.

These differences clearly depend on crystallographic orientation because dull car cross bright. Al bands contain abundant Neumann lines.
