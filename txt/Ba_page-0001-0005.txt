Barranca Blanca (Atacama, Chile) 2.5cm² 6 Sep 66. 13g sample from Bril. Mas. adjacent side no Wid. pattern visible, but etch has revealed kam & teen very nicely. the kam occurs as large creptals, Typical dimensions The taenite cor very reflective plessite!) irregular regions of typical dimensions 0.5 3 cm², and Etched 60 sec in nital. There is the order z q occurs as thes not 1am. taenite borders. The "bordess " the kam cryptals are generally cracks stretching from one taen. region & another. These are invariable slightly bridized and I can't determine whether they might also have schreib. in them. In many cases the teenite regions are not connected at all. There are many inclusions, most of which are rounded and typically I typically 1-2 mun and occur embedded in kam. Some been like schreib inclusions are next to taenite. The rounded inclusions are screibersite, trailite, Z brouge (Fess) and has some colorless trans. crystals in black (chromite?), Oxidation is very light along cracks and one is the chromite. and near 2 crust sides Fletcher, Min mag 8 265 sees chromite + a silicate.

Ban Rogue (Thailand) 4 af sample received from Prayong Augsuwathane svidely 3 kcrus Heal altered zone extends inward about 5 hem in upper right of sketch, but is not verible nexts to furion crust in lower right. Kamacile crossed by fine lives on right half of sample, with liny rhabdates separates along these lives. But won left side left side are kawaite crystals that don't show there lives. Except in heat altered zone, sevwall hama curved shows a high cove. of Fations Neumann lives, in several sets showing different orientations Neumann lines are not bent (movesdence of cold working) Four hamaciles have islands of schreiberate, typically ~0.3 x 0.7 mm (but variable). The hamacite bands outcropping in this section (~ 1.6 cm") are short and do not show parallel edges. The bandwidth is this difficult to estimate - it may be ^2(+ factor 2) mun Plessite + tacnite accounts for ~ 8-10% of the section. One region near the center has an area of 3 mm² ~ 2025 % of this in clear!. is No inclusions other than schrebersite recognized.
